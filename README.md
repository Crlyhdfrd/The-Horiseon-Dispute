# The-horiseon-dispute
realized many divs were able to be rpresented properly as sections.
also reassigned divs to aside for the sections along the side of the page.
css code was repeated many different times and was easily shorrtened by over half.
there was very much reading along with organization and problem solving.
caan be challenging when you begin to change code and the page begins to malfunction.
small panics but got it togeher as i went along with a little help from my TA's
